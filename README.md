**_Top 5 Cadbury Chocolate Bars Production._**

It took me a total of 8 hours to complete this task. I can finish it in one day, but due to my busy schedule, I am only able to spend 1-2 hours daily on coding, so it takes me like 5 days to complete this. Let me go through all the features this app has.

### Data Analysis

Upon opening the app, users will see two different types of charts. The first chart shows the top 5 Cadbury chocolate bars production based on the selected month, while the second chart shows the overall performance analysis of any chocolate bar the user picks. The user can see the exact number of chocolate bars by clicking on any area on the chart.

### Dark Mode

For a better user experience, I have implemented the dark mode feature in order to reduce eye strain. Once the dark mode is enabled, the text color and the background color will look different, but the color of the charts will stay the same.
